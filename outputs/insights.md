# LinkedIn Analytics – Insights

## Query 01: Monthly Overview

- This query returns a monthly summary of key metrics, including impressions and follower growth.

- With an increase in toal impressions this suggests that visibility may play an important role in driving follower gains over time.

## Query 02: Daily Follower Growth

- This query returns daily follower growth, highlighting the highest and lowest growth days and whether each day is above or below the overall average.

- Most days show follower growth above the overall average, while a smaller number of days experience sharp declines.

- This pattern suggests that overall follower growth is stable, with performance being disproportionately affected by a small number of low-growth days.

## Query 03: Topic Performance

- This query summarises performance by topic for November, showing total posts, impressions,
  engagement (likes + comments + shares), engagement rate, and each topic’s share of total impressions.

- Topic “Junior Dev” dominated visibility, generating 71.49% of all impressions in November — roughly 2.5× more than all other topics combined.

## Query 04: Top Post Per Topic

- This query returns the highest-impression post within each topic, allowing a fair “best example” comparison across topics.

- The top Junior Dev post generated 150,694 impressions, making it the highest-reach post across all topic leaders.

- Compared to the next best topic leader (Motivation, 35,879 impressions), the Junior Dev top post achieved 4.2x higher reach, suggesting Junior Dev content has the strongest potential for visibility.

## Query 05: Posting Activity vs Followers

- This query groups days by total impressions (low, medium, high) to examine whether higher reach aligns with increased follower growth.

- While the single highest-impression day (150k+) did not produce the highest follower gain, days classified as high impressions consistently show stronger follower growth compared to low-impression or no-post days.

- Days with no posting activity generated noticeably lower follower gains, suggesting that visibility (reach) plays a more meaningful role than posting frequency alone.
